# Copygrinder - the RESTful CMS

Copygrinder is a *just enough* CMS.  It provides a nice UI for content publishers, and then it gets out of the way of web developers.  It intentionally does **not**:

* try to be or embed itself in your website's application stack
* force a platform, web framework or templating language decision onto your website
* try to jam version control abstractions into a relational or noSQL datastore

Instead, it:

* provides a nice resource abstraction so you can GET the content out
* stores content in an actual version control system (git)

In short, Copygrinder enables a **decoupled content lifecycle**. Use it and you can spend more of your life solving **real problems**, not figuring out how to configure or extend a bloated, monolithic CMS runtime.
